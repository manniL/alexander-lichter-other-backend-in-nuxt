# Nuxt with a different JavaScript backend?

> **Note**
> This repository contains the code for the YouTube Video [Nuxt with other backends?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x81InsU6t0E).

In the video, I show how to use Nuxt with a different JavaScript backends like Express, Fastify, or Hono. The video highlights how to integrate these backends with Nuxt and Nitro and also whether or not this is a good idea after all
